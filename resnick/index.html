<P><B>Abstract</B>
<P><B></B>In recent years, there has been a growing fascination with
decentralized systems and self-organizing phenomena. Increasingly, people are
choosing decentralized models for the organizations and technologies that they
construct in the world, and for the theories that they construct about the
world. But even as decentralized ideas spread through the culture, there is a
deep-seated resistance to such ideas. In trying to understand patterns in the
world, people often assume centralized control where none exists (for example,
assuming that a "leader bird" guides the rest of the flock). To probe how people
think about decentralized systems, and to help them develop new ways of thinking
about such systems, I developed a programmable modeling environment (called
StarLogo) with which people can easily create and experiment with decentralized
systems. StarLogo allows users to control the actions and interactions of
thousands of artificial "creatures" on the computer screen. I describe three
StarLogo projects created by high-school students. Based on my observations of
these (and other) students, I analyze the nature of the centralized mindset, and
I discuss how people, through engagement with new types of computational tools
and activities, can begin to move beyond the centralized mindset.
<P>
<P><B>1. Introduction</B>
<P><B></B>During the past decade, there has been a surge of scientific interest
in the so-called "sciences of complexity"--the investigation of how complex
phenomena can arise from simple interactions among simple parts. New research
projects on chaos, self-organization, adaptive systems, nonlinear dynamics, and
artificial life are all part of this growing interest in complex systems. The
interest has even spread from the scientific community to popular culture, with
the publication of best-selling books about research into complex systems (e.g.,
Gleick, 1987; Pagels, 1988; Levy, 1992; Waldrop, 1992).
<P>The sciences of complexity present not only scientific challenges but
educational and epistemological ones, raising questions about how people view
and make sense of the world. In particular, these new sciences tend to highlight
<I>decentralized</I> models of the world--in contrast to traditional scientific
models based on centralized control and centralized causes. Scientists are
reexamining their models of biological systems, social systems, and
technological systems. For example, traditional theories of bird flocking were
based on the idea of a "leader" bird at the front of the flock. Newer theories
view bird flocks as decentralized and self-organizing (e.g., Heppner &amp;
Grenander, 1990). Each bird in the flock follows a set of simple rules, reacting
to the movements of the birds nearby it. Orderly flock patterns arise from these
simple, local interactions. None of the birds has a sense of the overall flock
pattern. The bird in front is not a "leader" in any meaningful sense--it just
happens to end up there.
<P>But even as the influence of decentralized ideas grows in the scientific
community, there is a deep-seated resistance to such ideas. Most people seem to
have strong attachments to centralized ways of thinking. When people see
patterns in the world (like a flock of birds), they generally assume that there
is some type of centralized control (a leader of the flock). According to this
way of thinking, a pattern can exist only if someone (or something) creates and
orchestrates the pattern. Everything must have a single cause, an ultimate
controlling factor. In general, decentralized approaches are ignored,
undervalued, and overlooked. Centralized solutions are seen as <I>the</I>
solution. The widespread resistance to evolutionary theories is an example: Many
people still insist that someone or something must have explicitly designed the
complex, orderly structures that characterize living systems. They resist the
idea that complexity can be formed through a decentralized process of variation
and selection.
<P>This paper reports on the beginnings of a research effort to study
centralized and decentralized ways of thinking about complex systems. The effort
is based on a constructionist approach to learning research (Papert, 1991).
Broadly, the research effort aims to identify people's intuitive models for
understanding complex systems, and to develop tools and activities that both
challenge and leverage those intuitions to help people develop a richer set of
models for thinking about complexity.
<P>The research effort focuses particularly on pre-college students. It consists
of several interwoven threads:
<P>* <I>Probing students' conceptions</I>. How do students think about and make
sense of complex phenomena? To what extent do they assume centralized causes and
centralized control? In the cognitive-science community, there is a rich
literature on "folk physics," examining how people think about concepts from
Newtonian physics (e.g., McCloskey, 1983; diSessa, 1988). By analogy, this
project might be dubbed "folk systems science," aiming to understand how people
think about the behaviors of systems. The goal is to understand the "pieces of
knowledge" or "knowledge fragments" (diSessa, 1988) that underlie students'
conceptions of systems, and to examine how these intuitive models present
obstacles and opportunities for learning.
<P>* <I>Developing new conceptual tools</I>. In recent years, scientists have
developed a variety of analytic techniques for describing complex systems and
making accurate predictions about the behaviors of such systems. The goal here
is very different: to develop heuristics, metaphors, and qualitative tools to
help people think about decentralized systems in new ways.
<P>* <I>Developing new computational tools</I>. New computational tools can be
useful both for probing how people think about particular ideas and for
providing a framework to help people develop new ways of thinking. In this case,
the goal is to develop computational tools that allow people to explore,
manipulate, and construct decentralized systems--for example, enabling students
to create and manipulate computational models of ant colonies, market economies,
or immune systems. A major design challenge is to create computational tools
that highlight and make salient core intellectual ideas about decentralized
systems, so that people naturally engage in thinking about these ideas (and
develop new representations for thinking about decentralized systems) as they
make use of the tools.
<P>This paper describes the first steps in this enterprise. In particular, it
describes a new programmable modeling environment, called StarLogo, that allows
students to construct and experiment with decentralized systems. The paper
describes the ideas underlying the design of StarLogo, and it presents three
short case studies of high-school students working on StarLogo projects. These
case studies provide an initial glimpse of how students think about complex
systems, and how they begin to think about such systems in new ways as they
become engaged with new computational tools and activities. Based on the
experiences of the high-school students, the paper proposes a set of heuristics
for thinking about decentralized systems.
<P><B></B>
<P><B>2. Tools for Thinking about Decentralization</B>
<P><B></B>In some ways, people already have a great deal of experience with
decentralized systems: they observe decentralized systems in the natural world,
and they participate in decentralized social systems in their lives. But, of
course, observation and participation do not necessarily lead to strong
intuitions or deep understanding. People observed bird flocks for thousands of
years before anyone suggested that flocks are leader-less. And people
participate in traffic jams without much understanding of the decentralized
interactions that cause the jams. Observation and participation are not enough.
People need a richer sense of engagement with decentralized systems. One way to
do that is to give people opportunities to <I>design</I> decentralized systems.
<P>At first glance, this approach to the study of decentralized systems might
seem like a contradiction. After all, how can you design decentralized
phenomena? By definition, decentralized patterns are created without a
centralized designer. But there are ways to use design in the study of
decentralized systems. Imagine that you could design the behaviors of lots of
individual components--then observe the patterns that result from all of the
interactions. This is a different sort of design: You control the actions of the
parts, not of the whole. You are acting as a designer, but the resulting
patterns are not designed.
<P>Over the years, computer scientists have developed a variety of computational
tools that can be used for this type of "decentralized design." Cellular
automata represent one example (Toffoli &amp; Margolus, 1987). In cellular
automata, a virtual world is divided into a grid of "cells." Each cell holds a
certain amount of "state." (On the computer screen, different states are usually
represented by different colors.) In the simplest cases, each cell might hold
just a single piece of state, indicating whether the cell is "alive" or "dead."
There is a transition rule that determines how each cell changes from one
generation to the next. Transition rules are typically based on the states of a
cell's "neighbors." For example, a cell might become "alive" if the majority of
its neighboring cells are alive. Each cell executes the same rule, over and
over. Cellular automata have proved to be an extraordinarily rich framework for
exploring self-organizing phenomena. Simple rules for each cell sometimes lead
to complex and unexpected large-scale structures.
<P>To engage students in thinking about decentralized systems, I wanted to
provide an environment similar to cellular automata, but more connected to
students' interests and experiences. While cellular automata are well-suited for
computer hackers and mathematicians, they seem ill-suited for people who have
less experience (or less interest in) manipulating abstract systems. The objects
and operations in cellular automata are not familiar to most people. The idea of
writing "transition rules" for "cells" is not an idea that most people can
relate to.
<P>Instead, I decided to create an environment based on the familiar ideas of
"creatures" and "colonies." The goal was to enable students to investigate the
ways that colony-level behaviors (such as bird flocks or ant foraging trails)
can arise from interactions among individual creatures. (I am using the terms
"creature" and "colony" rather broadly. On a highway, each car can be considered
a "creature," and a traffic jam can be considered the "colony.") Another
important goal was to enable students to <I>build their own models</I>, not
merely manipulate pre-existing models.
<P>Logo seemed like a good starting point for my computational system (Papert,
1980; Harvey, 1985). The traditional Logo "turtle" can be used to represent
almost any type of object in the world: an ant in a colony, a car in a traffic
jam, an antibody in the immune system, or a molecule in a gas. But traditional
versions of the Logo language are missing several key features that are needed
for explorations of colony-type behaviors. So I developed a new, extended
version of Logo. This new version of Logo, called StarLogo, extends Logo in
three major ways (Resnick, 1991, 1994).
<P>First, <I>StarLogo has many more turtles</I>. While commercial versions of
Logo typically have only a few turtles, StarLogo has <I>thousands</I> of
turtles, and all of the turtles can perform their actions at the same time, in
parallel. (The initial version of StarLogo was implemented on a
massively-parallel computer, the Connection Machine. We have since implemented
StarLogo on traditional sequential computers by simulating parallelism.) For
many colony-type explorations, having a large number of turtles is not just a
nicety, it is a necessity. In many cases, the behavior of a colony changes
qualitatively when the number of creatures is increased. An ant colony with 10
ants might not be able to make a stable pheromone trail to a food source,
whereas a colony with 100 ants (following the exact same rules) might.
<P>Second, <I>StarLogo turtles have better "senses." </I>The traditional Logo
turtle was designed primarily as a "drawing turtle," for creating geometric
shapes and exploring geometric ideas. But the StarLogo turtle is more of a
"behavioral turtle." StarLogo turtles come equipped with "senses." They can
detect (and distinguish) other turtles nearby, and they can "sniff" scents in
the world. Such turtle-turtle and turtle-world interactions are essential for
creating and experimenting with decentralized and self-organizing phenomena.
Parallelism alone is not enough. If each turtle just acts on its own, without
any interactions, interesting colony-level behaviors will generally not arise.
<P>Third, <I>StarLogo reifies the turtles' world</I>. In traditional versions of
Logo, the turtles' world does not have many distinguishing features. The world
is simply a place where the turtles draw with their "pens." Each pixel of the
world has a single piece of state information--its color. StarLogo attaches a
much higher status to the turtles' world. The world is divided into small square
sections called <I>patches</I>. The patches have many of the same capabilities
as turtles, except that they can not move. Each patch can hold an arbitrary
variety of information. For example, if the turtles are programmed to release a
"chemical" as they move, each patch can keep track of the amount of chemical
that has been released within its borders. Patches can execute StarLogo
commands, just as turtles do. For example, each patch could diffuse some of its
"chemical" into neighboring patches, or it could grow "food" based on the level
of chemical within its borders. Thus, the environment is given a status equal to
that of the creatures inhabiting it.
<P>StarLogo programs can be conceptualized as turtles moving on top of (and
interacting with) a cellular-automata grid. All types of interactions are
possible: turtle-turtle, turtle-patch, and patch-patch interactions. StarLogo
places special emphasis on <I>local</I> interactions--that is, interactions
among turtles and patches that are spatially near one another. Thus, StarLogo is
well-suited for explorations of self-organizing phenomena, in which large-scale
patterns arise from local interactions. In addition, the massively parallel
nature of StarLogo makes it well-suited for explorations of probabilistic and
statistical concepts--and studies of people's thinking about these concepts
(Wilensky, 1993).
<P>Figure 1 shows a StarLogo simulation of creatures aggregating into clusters.
In this example, each creature emits a chemical pheromone, and it also moves in
the direction where the pheromone is strongest (that is, it "follows the
gradient" of the pheromone). At the same time, the patches cause the pheromone
to diffuse and evaporate. With this simple strategy, the creatures quickly
aggregate into clusters--demonstrating that aggregation can arise from a
decentralized mechanism.

<P>In some ways, the ideas underlying StarLogo parallel the ideas underlying the
early versions of Logo itself. In the late 1960's, Logo aimed to make then-new
ideas from the computer-science community (like procedural abstraction and
recursion) accessible to a larger number of users (Papert, 1980). Similarly,
StarLogo aims to make 1990's ideas from computer science (like massive
parallelism) accessible to a larger audience. And whereas Logo introduced a new
object (the turtle) to facilitate explorations of particular
mathematical/scientific ideas, such as differential geometry (Abelson &amp;
diSessa, 1980), StarLogo introduces another new object (the patch) to facilitate
explorations of other mathematical/scientific ideas (such as self-organization).
<P><B></B>
<P><B>3. Student Projects</B>
<P><B></B>About a dozen high-school students participated in the initial phase
of this research project (using a version of StarLogo on the Connection
Machine). The students had widely varying levels of experience with computers.
The students came from a variety of ethnic backgrounds--roughly half were
immigrants or first-generation Americans. About two-thirds of the students were
male, one-third female. All of the participants shared a willingness to come to
MIT to work on an experimental project. All student names used in this paper are
pseudonyms.
<P>Students typically came to MIT for eight to ten sessions, each lasting 60 to
90 minutes. Most students worked together in pairs. I worked directly with the
students, suggesting projects, asking questions, challenging assumptions,
helping with programming, and encouraging students to reflect on their
experiences as they worked with StarLogo. Computer interactions were saved in
computer files, and all discussions were recorded on audio tape.
<P>In the early sessions, I typically showed students existing StarLogo
programs. The students experimented with the programs, trying different
parameters and making slight modifications of the programs. As the sessions
progressed, I encouraged students to develop their own projects ideas and
construct their own models, based on personal interests. This section describes
three StarLogo projects created by the students.
<P><B>3.1 Traffic Jams</B>
<P><B></B>Ari and Fadhil were students at a public high-school in the Boston
area. Both enjoyed working with computers, but neither had a very strong
mathematical or scientific background. At the time Ari and Fadhil started
working with StarLogo, they were also taking a driver's education class. Each
had turned 16 years old a short time before, and they were excited about getting
their driver's licenses. Much of their conversation focused on cars. When I gave
Ari and Fadhil a collection of articles to read, a <I>Scientific American</I>
article titled "Vehicular Traffic Flow" (Herman &amp; Gardels, 1963) captured
their attention.
<P>Traffic flow is rich domain for studying collective behavior. Interactions
among cars in a traffic flow can lead to surprising group phenomena. Consider a
long road with no cross streets or intersections. What if we added some traffic
lights along the road? The traffic lights would seem to serve no constructive
purpose. It would be natural to assume that the traffic lights would reduce the
overall traffic throughput (number of cars per unit time). But in some
situations, additional traffic lights actually <I>improve</I> overall traffic
throughput. The New York City Port Authority, for example, found that it could
increase traffic throughput in the Holland Tunnel by 6 percent by deliberately
stopping some cars before they entered the tunnel (Herman &amp; Gardels, 1963).
<P>Traditional studies of traffic flow rely on sophisticated analytic techniques
(from fields like queuing theory). But many of the same traffic phenomena can be
explored with simple StarLogo programs. To get started, Ari and Fadhil decided
to create a one-lane highway. (Later, they experimented with multiple lanes.)
Ari suggested adding a police radar trap somewhere along the road, to catch cars
going above the speed limit. But he also wanted each car to have its own radar
detector, so that cars would know to slow down when they approached the radar
trap.
<P>After some discussion, Ari and Fadhil decided that each StarLogo turtle/car
should follow three basic rules:
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>If there is a car close ahead of you, slow down.<BR>
  <LI>If there are not any cars close ahead of you, speed up (unless you are
  already moving at the speed limit).<BR>
  <LI>If you detect a radar trap, slow down.<BR></LI></UL>Ari and Fadhil
implemented these rules in StarLogo. They expected that a traffic jam would form
behind the radar trap, and indeed it did (Figure 2). After a few dozen
iterations of the StarLogo program, a line of cars started to form to the left
of the radar trap. The cars moved slowly through the trap, then sped away as
soon as they passed it. Ari explained: "First one car slows down for the radar
trap, then the one behind it slows down, then the one behind that one, and then
you've got a traffic jam."

<P><I></I>
<P><I></I>I asked Ari and Fadhil what would happen if only <I>some</I> of the
cars had radar detectors. Ari predicted that only some of the cars would slow
down for the radar trap. Fadhil had a different idea: "The ones that have radar
detectors will slow down, which will cause the other ones to slow down." Fadhil
was right. The students modified the StarLogo program so that only 25 percent of
the cars had radar detectors. The result: the traffic flow looked exactly the
same as when all of the cars had radar detectors.

<P><I>Figure 3: Traffic jam without radar trap</I>
<P><I>(Cars move left to right, but jam moves right to left)</I>
<P><I></I>
<P><I></I>What if <I>none</I> of the cars had radar detectors--or, equivalently,
if the radar trap were removed entirely? With no radar trap, the cars would be
controlled by just two simple rules: if you see another car close ahead, slow
down; if not, speed up. The rules could not be much simpler. At first, Fadhil
predicted that the traffic flow would become uniform: cars would be evenly
spaced, traveling at a constant speed. Without the radar trap, he reasoned, what
could cause a jam? But when the students ran the program, a traffic jam formed
(Figure 3). Along parts of the road, the cars were tightly packed and moving
slowly. Elsewhere, they were spread out and moving at the speed limit.
<P>Ari and Fadhil were surprised. And when I showed Ari and Fadhil's program to
other high-school students, they too were surprised. In general, the students
expected the cars to end up evenly spaced along the highway, separated by equal
distances. Several of them talked about the cars reaching an "equilibrium,"
characterized by equal spacing. No one expected a traffic jam to form. Some of
their predictions:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Emily: [The cars will] just speed along, just keep going
  along...they will end up staggered, in intervals.</I>
  <P><I>Frank: Nothing will be wrong with it. Cars will just go...There's no
  obstacles. The cars will just keep going, and that's it.</I>
  <P><I>Ramesh: They will probably adjust themselves to a uniform distance from
  each other.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I></I>When I ran the simulation, and traffic jams began to form, the
students were shocked. In their comments, most students revealed a strong
commitment to the idea that some type of "seed" (like an accident or a broken
bridge) is needed to start a traffic jam. Perhaps Frank expressed it best: "I
didn't think there would be any problem, since there was nothing there." If
there is <I>nothing there</I>--if there is no seed--there should not be a
traffic jam. Traffic jams do not just happen; they must have localizable causes.
And the cause must come from outside the system (not from the cars themselves).
Some researchers who study systems talk about <I>exogenous</I> (external) and
<I>endogenous</I> (internal) factors affecting the behavior of a system. In the
minds of the students, patterns (such as traffic jams) can be formed only by
exogenous factors.
<P>Fadhil suggested that the jams were caused by differences in the initial
speeds of the cars. So the students changed the StarLogo program, starting all
of the cars at the exact same speed. But the jams still formed. Fadhil quickly
understood. At the beginning of the program, the cars were placed at random
positions on the road. Random positioning led to uneven spacing between the
cars, and uneven spacing could also provide the "seed" from which a traffic jam
could form. Fadhil explained: "Some of the cars start closer to other cars.
Like, four spaces between two of them, and two spaces between others. A car
that's only two spaces behind another car slows down, then the one behind it
slows down."
<P>Next, they changed the program so that the cars were evenly spaced. Sure
enough, no traffic jams formed. All of the cars uniformly accelerated up to the
speed limit. But Ari and Fadhil recognized that such a situation would be
difficult to set up in the real world. The distances between the cars had to be
just right, and the cars had to start at exactly the same time--like a platoon
of soldiers starting to march in unison.
<P><B>3.2 Termites and Wood Chips</B>
<P><B></B>Termites are among the master architects of the animal world. On the
plains of Africa, termites construct giant mound-like nests rising more than 10
feet tall, thousands of times taller than the termites themselves. Inside the
mounds are intricate networks of tunnels and chambers. Each termite colony has a
queen. But, as in ant colonies, the termite queen does not "tell" the termite
workers what to do. On the termite construction site, there is no construction
foreman, no one in charge of the master plan. Rather, each termite carries out a
relatively simple task. Termites are practically blind, so they must interact
with each other (and with the world around them) primarily through their senses
of touch and smell. From local interactions among thousands of termites,
impressive structures emerge.
<P>The global-from-local nature of termite constructions makes them well-suited
for StarLogo explorations. Callie, one of the high-school students, worked on a
simple form of termite construction: she programmed a set of termites to collect
wood chips and put them into piles. At the start of the program, wood chips were
scattered randomly throughout the termites' world. The challenge was to make the
termites organize the wood chips into a few, orderly piles.
<P>Callie and I worked together on the project. We started with a very simple
strategy, programming each individual termite to obey the following rules:
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>If you are not carrying anything and you bump into a wood chip, pick it
  up.<BR>
  <LI>If you are carrying a wood chip and you bump into another wood chip, put
  down the wood chip you're carrying.<BR></LI></UL>At first, Callie and I were
both skeptical that this simple strategy would work. There was no mechanism for
preventing termites from taking wood chips away from existing piles. So while
termites are putting new wood chips on a pile, other termites might be taking
wood chips away from it. It seemed like a good prescription for getting nowhere.
But we pushed ahead and implemented the strategy in a StarLogo program, with
1000 termites and 2000 wood chips scattered in a 128x128 grid.
<P>We tried the program, and (much to our surprise) it worked quite well. At
first, the termites gathered the wood chips into hundreds of small piles. But
gradually, the number of piles declined, and the number of wood chips in each
pile increased (see Figure 4). After 2000 iterations, there were about 100
piles, with an average of 15 wood chips in each pile. After 10,000 iterations,
there were fewer than 50 piles left, with an average of 30 wood chips in each
pile. After 20,000 iterations, only 34 piles remained, with an average of 44
wood chips in each pile. The process was rather slow, and it was frustrating to
watch, as termites often carried wood chips away from well-established piles.
But, all in all, the program worked quite well.
<P>Why did it work? As we watched the program, it suddenly seemed obvious.
Imagine what happens when the termites (by chance) remove all of the wood chips
from a particular pile. Because all of the wood chips are gone from that spot,
termites will never again drop wood chips there. So the pile has no way of
restarting.
<P>As long as a pile exists, its size is a two-way street: it can either grow or
shrink. But the <I>existence</I> of a pile is a one-way street: once it is gone,
it is gone forever. Thus, a pile is somewhat analogous to a species of creatures
in the real world. As long as the species exists, the number of individuals in
the species can go up or down. But once all of the individuals are gone, the
species is extinct, gone forever. In these cases, zero is a "trapped state":
once the number of creatures in a species (or the number of wood chips in a
pile) goes to zero, it can never rebound.
<P>Of course, the analogy between species and piles breaks down in some ways.
New species are sometimes created, as offshoots of existing species. But in the
termite program, there is no way to create a new pile. The program starts with
roughly 2000 wood chips. These wood chips can be viewed as 2000 "piles," each
with a single wood chip. As the program runs, some piles disappear, and no new
piles are created. So the total number of piles decreases monotonically.

<P><I></I><B>3.3 Ant Cemeteries</B>
<P><B></B>Two high-school students, Frank and Ramesh, decided to work on a
StarLogo project involving ants. In their own (real) ant farms, they had
observed ants gathering their dead colleagues into neat piles. They wondered:
how does that happen?
<P>This question is similar to the question that Callie and I explored, with
ants taking the place of termites, and dead ants taking the place of wood chips.
But Frank and Ramesh approached the problem very differently than Callie and I.
Whereas Callie and I focused on decentralized strategies, Frank and Ramesh
gravitated toward centralized ones.
<P>Ramesh's first idea was that each ant could create its own cemetery, on the
spot where the ant found its first dead ant. This strategy avoids all of the
"messiness" of interaction among the ants. But at a cost: the ant colony will
end up with as many cemeteries as there are live ants. In effect, Ramesh's
strategy turns every ant into a "leader" of its own one-member colony.
<P>Frank suggested an alternative idea: "There could be some chemical. Each
turtle will look for where the chemical is. And then all turtles will put the
dead-ants around the patch where the chemical is." One patch, with chemical,
acts as the seed from which a cemetery will grow. I pointed out a problem with
this approach.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Mitchel: So there would be a few designated places with
  chemical. Someone or something has to decide on those places. Who is going to
  make that decision?</I>
  <P><I>Frank: Maybe God? [Laughs]</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I></I>With his laugh, Frank indicated that he was aware of the problem. He
knew that he could not rely on "God" to create the "seed" for the ant cemetery.
But who else (or what else) could create the seed for the cemetery? After a
while, Frank shifted to another idea: "Maybe the leader of this group of ants
tells them where to put the dead ants." With this idea, control would still be
centralized, but a "leader" would be in control instead of "God."
(Interestingly, Frank did not say: "Maybe the group needs a leader to decide
where..." Rather, he just assumed that the group <I>must</I> have a leader. The
only question was what the leader should do.)
<P>Ramesh also liked the idea of a single pre-designated cemetery. When I
suggested that the ants might not need a pre-designated cemetery, Ramesh
rejected the idea: "Why would an ant try to gather other dead ants if there is
no reason for it? If you make just one place, then the ants have a goal to put
dead ants in one place." So, according to Ramesh, a pre-designated cemetery is
needed to give the ants a <I>goal</I>, a reason for collecting dead ants. In
Ramesh's world view, there is no place for "unintended" patterns, arising from
decentralized interactions. For an ordered cemetery to form, according to
Ramesh, the ants must view the creation of the cemetery as an explicit goal.
<P>Frank and Ramesh wrote several StarLogo programs based on the fixed-cemetery
idea. They developed a nice strategy to help live ants find dead ants more
quickly: each dead ant emitted a chemical scent, and each live ant (when not
carrying a dead ant) followed the gradient of the scent. In some versions, each
live ant "knew" exactly where the cemetery was. After picking up a dead ant, the
ant would head directly toward the cemetery. In other versions, the ant would
wander randomly until it bumped into the cemetery.
<P>After a while, I encouraged Frank and Ramesh to consider strategies without a
fixed, pre-existing cemetery. For a while, they considered a strategy similar to
the one Callie and I used with the termites: live ants should pick dead ants,
and put them down near other dead ants. But Frank and Ramesh were very concerned
about ants removing dead-ants from already-existing piles.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Ramesh: Once the ants place them [the dead ants], we have to
  set a rule that they don't get picked up again...You could have one ant trying
  to create a pile, and another ant trying to destroy it... You can't break up a
  pile. It has to keep getting bigger.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I></I>Callie and I had similar worries before trying out the strategy in the
termite project. But Frank and Ramesh carried their concerns to an extreme,
insisting on what might be called a "monotonic imperative": piles must always
grow and never shrink. They were reluctant to even try the strategy. They were
sure that it was doomed to failure. Eventually, Frank and Ramesh created a
decentralized solution, but only after a great deal of resistance.
<P>
<P><B>4. The Centralized Mindset</B>
<P><B></B>In working on their StarLogo projects, many students showed a strong
inclination toward centralized thinking, a phenomenon I call the <I>centralized
mindset</I>. In the traffic project, students assumed that some centralized
influence (such as a radar trap or a broken bridge) must underlie the formation
of traffic jams. In their minds, a jam can not happen if there is "nothing
there." They could not imagine a traffic jam arising from simple, decentralized
interactions among cars. In the ant-cemetery project, Frank and Ramesh developed
a range of centralized strategies. In some cases, they relied on a "leader ant"
to tell the other ants where to put the dead bodies. In other cases, they argued
for a pre-designated cemetery spot. They could not imagine the cemeteries
arising from decentralized interactions among the ants.
<P>In general, when students observed patterns or structures in StarLogo
programs, they assumed (at least initially) that patterns were created either
<I>by lead</I> or <I>by seed</I>. That is, they assumed that a <I>leader</I>
orchestrated the pattern (e.g., the "leader ant," or the bird at the front of
the flock), or they assumed that some <I>seed</I> (some pre-existing, built-in
inhomogeneity in the environment) gave rise to the pattern, much as a grain of
sand gives rise to a pearl.
<P>Psychologist David Leiser, in his studies of children's understanding of
economic concepts, has found a similar preference for centralized explanations.
In interviews with Israeli children between 8 and 15 years old, Leiser (1983)
found that nearly half of the children assumed that the government sets all
prices and pays all salaries. Even children who said that employers pay salaries
often believed that the government provides the money for the salaries. A
significant majority of the students assumed that the government pays the
increased salaries after a strike. And many younger children had the seemingly
contradictory belief that the government is also responsible for organizing
strikes. As Leiser writes: "The child finds it easier to refer unexplained
phenomena to the deliberate actions of a clearly defined entity, such as the
government, than to impersonal `market forces.'"
<P>The centralized mindset is not just a misconception of the scientifically
naive. A bias toward centralized theories can be seen throughout the history of
science, with scientists remaining committed to centralized explanations, even
in the face of discrediting evidence. The history of research on slime-mold
cells, as told by Evelyn Fox Keller (1985), provides a striking example. At
certain stages of their life cycle, slime-mold cells gather together into
clusters. For many years, scientists believed that the aggregation process was
coordinated by specialized slime-mold cells, known as "founder" or "pacemaker"
cells. According to this theory, each pacemaker cell sends out a chemical
signal, telling other slime-mold cells to gather around it, resulting in a
cluster. In 1970, Keller and Segel (1970) proposed an alternative model, showing
how slime-mold cells can aggregate without any specialized cells. Nevertheless,
for the following decade, other researchers continued to assume that special
pacemaker cells were required to initiate the aggregation process. As Keller
(1985) writes, with an air of disbelief: "The pacemaker view was embraced with a
degree of enthusiasm that suggests that this question was in some sense
foreclosed." By the early 1980's, based on further research by Cohen and Hagan
(1981), researchers began to accept the idea of aggregation among homogeneous
cells, without any pacemaker. But the decade-long resistance serves as some
indication of the strength of the centralized mindset.
<P>In some ways, it is not surprising that people have such strong commitments
to centralized approaches. Many phenomena in the world <I>are</I>, in fact,
organized by a central designer. These phenomena act to reinforce the
centralized mindset. When people see neat rows of corn in a field, they assume
(correctly) that the corn was planted by a farmer. When people watch a ballet,
they assume (correctly) that the movements of the dancers were planned by a
choreographer. When people see a watch, they assume (correctly) that it was
designed by a watchmaker.
<P>Moreover, most people participate in social systems (such as families and
school classrooms) where power and authority are very centralized. These
hierarchical systems serve as strong models. Many people are probably unaware
that other types of organization are even possible. In an earlier research
project, I developed a programming language (called MultiLogo) based on "agents"
that communicated with one another. In using the language, children invariably
put one of the agents "in charge" of the others. One student explicitly referred
to the agent in charge as "the teacher." Another referred to it as "the mother"
(Resnick, 1990).
<P>Perhaps most important, our intuitions about systems in the world are deeply
influenced by our conceptions of ourselves. The human mind is composed of
thousands of interacting entities (e.g., Minsky, 1987), but each of us
experiences our own self as a singular entity. This is a very convenient,
perhaps necessary, illusion for surviving in the world. When I do something,
whether I'm painting a picture or organizing a party, I feel as if "I" am
playing the role of the "central actor." It feels like there is one entity in
charge: me. So it is quite natural that I should expect most systems to involve
a central actor, or some entity that is in charge. The centralized mindset might
be viewed as one aspect (and a lasting remnant) of the egocentrism that Piaget
identified in early childhood.
<P><B></B>
<P><B>5. Decentralized Thinking</B>
<P><B></B>The initial case studies of students working on StarLogo projects
provide strong evidence of the centralized mindset. As students began working
with StarLogo, they almost always assumed centralized causes in the patterns
they observed, and they almost always imposed centralized control when they
wanted to create patterns.
<P>But as students continued to work on StarLogo projects, most of them began to
develop new ways of thinking about decentralization. In almost all cases, they
developed an appreciation for and a fascination with decentralized systems. At
one point, while we were struggling to get our termite program working, I asked
Callie if we should give up on our decentralized approach and program the
termites to take their wood chips to pre-designated spots. She quickly dismissed
this suggestion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Mitchel: We could write the program so that the termites know
  where the piles are. As soon as a termite picks up a wood chip, it could just
  go to the pile and put it down.</I>
  <P><I>Callie: Oh, that's boring!</I>
  <P><I>Mitchel: Why do you think that's boring?</I>
  <P><I>Callie: Cause you're telling them what to do.</I>
  <P><I>Mitchel: Is this more like the way it would be in the real world?</I>
  <P><I>Callie: Yeah. You would almost know what to expect if you tell them to
  go to a particular spot and put it down. You know that there will be three
  piles. Whereas here, you don't know how many mounds there are going to be. Or
  if the number of mounds will increase or decrease. Or things like that... This
  way, they [the termites] made the piles by themselves. It wasn't like they
  [the piles] were artificially put in.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I></I>For Callie, pre-programmed behavior, even if effective, was "boring."
Callie preferred the decentralized approach since it made the termites seem more
independent ("they made the piles by themselves") and less predictable ("you
don't know how many mounds there are going to be").
<P>Over time, other students shared Callie's fascination with decentralization,
though they often struggled in their efforts to use decentralized strategies in
analyzing and constructing new systems. As I worked with students, I assembled a
list of "guiding heuristics" that students used as they began to develop richer
models of decentralized phenomena. These heuristics are not very "strong." They
are not "rules" for making sense of decentralized systems. Rather, they are
loose collections of ideas associated with decentralized thinking.
Pedagogically, they serve as good discussion points for provoking people to
think about decentralization. They also serve as a type of measuring stick for
conceptual change: as students worked on StarLogo projects, they gradually began
to integrate these heuristics into their own thinking and discourse. In this
section, I discuss five of these guiding heuristics.
<P><B>* Positive Feedback Isn't Always Negative</B>
<P><B></B>When people think about the scientific idea of positive feedback, they
typically think of the screeching sound that results when a microphone is placed
near a speaker. Positive feedback is viewed as a destructive force, making
things spiral out of control. By contrast, negative feedback is viewed as very
useful, keeping things under control. Negative feedback is symbolized by the
thermostat, keeping room temperature at a desired level by turning the heater on
and off as needed.
<P>When I asked high-school students about positive feedback, most were not
familiar with the term, but they were certainly familiar with the concept. When
I explained what I meant by positive feedback, students quickly generated
examples involving something getting out of control, often with destructive
consequences. One student talked about scratching a mosquito bite, which made
the bite itch even more, so she scratched it some more, which made it itch even
more, and so on. Another student talked about stock-market crashes: a few people
start selling, which makes more people start selling, which makes even more
people start selling, and so on.
<P>Despite these negative images, positive feedback often plays a crucial role
in decentralized phenomena. Economist Brian Arthur (1990) points to the
geographic distribution of cities and industries as an example of a
self-organizing process driven by positive feedback. Once a small nucleus of
high-technology electronics companies started in Santa Clara County south of San
Francisco, an infrastructure developed to serve the needs of those companies.
That infrastructure encouraged even more electronics companies to locate in
Santa Clara County, which encouraged the development of an even more robust
infrastructure. And thus, Silicon Valley was born.
<P>For some students who used StarLogo, the idea of positive feedback provided a
new way of looking at their world. One day, one student came to me excitedly. He
had been in downtown Boston at lunch time, and he had a vision. He imagined two
people walking into a deli to buy lunch.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Once they get their food, they don't eat it there. They bring
  it back with them. Other people on the street smell the sandwiches and see the
  deli bag, and they say, `Hey, maybe I'll go to the deli for lunch today!" They
  were just walking down the street, minding their own business, and all of the
  sudden they want to go to the deli. As more people go to the deli, there's
  even more smell and more bags. So more people go to the deli. But then the
  deli runs out of food. There's no more smell on the street from the
  sandwiches. So no one else goes to the deli.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>* Randomness Can Help Create Order</B>
<P><B></B>Like positive feedback, randomness has a bad image. Most people see
randomness as annoying at best, destructive at worst. They view randomness in
opposition to order: randomness undoes order, it makes things disorderly.
<P>In fact, randomness plays an important role in creating order in many
self-organizing systems. As discussed earlier, people often assume that "seeds"
are needed to initiate patterns and structures. In general, this is a useful
intuition. The problem is that most people have too narrow a conception of
"seeds." They think only of preexisting inhomogeneities in the environment--like
a broken bridge on the highway, or a piece of food in an ant's world.
<P>This narrow view of seeds causes misintuitions. In self-organizing systems,
seeds are neither preexisting nor externally imposed. Rather, self-organizing
systems often create <I>their own</I> seeds. It is here that randomness plays a
crucial role. Random fluctuations act as the "seeds" from which patterns and
structures grow. Randomness creates the initial seeds, then positive feedback
makes the seeds grow. For example, the differing velocities of cars on a highway
create the seeds from which traffic jams can grow.
<P><B>* A Flock Isn't a Big Bird</B>
<P><B></B>In trying to make sense of decentralized systems and self-organizing
phenomena, the idea of <I>levels</I> is critically important. Interactions among
objects at one level give rise to new types of objects at another level.
Interactions among slime-mold cells give rise to slime-mold clusters.
Interactions among cars give rise to traffic jams. Interactions among birds give
rise to flocks.
<P>In many cases, the objects on one level behave very differently than objects
on another level. For some high-school students, these differences in behavior
were very surprising (at least initially). For example, the students working on
the StarLogo traffic project were shocked by the behavior of the traffic jams:
the jams moved backwards even though all of the cars within the jams were moving
forward.
<P>Confusion of levels is not restricted to scientifically naive high-school
students. I showed the StarLogo traffic program to two visiting computer
scientists. They were not at all surprised that the traffic jams were moving
backwards. They were well aware of that phenomenon. But then one of the
researchers said: "You know, I've heard that's why there are so many accidents
on the freeways in Los Angeles. The traffic jams are moving backwards and the
cars are rushing forward, so there are lots of accidents." The other researcher
thought for a moment, then replied: "Wait a minute. Cars crash into other cars,
not into traffic jams." In short, he believed that the first researcher had
confused levels, mixing cars and jams inappropriately. The two researchers then
spent half an hour trying to sort out the problem. It is an indication of the
underdeveloped state of decentralized thinking in our culture that two
sophisticated computer scientists needed to spend half an hour trying to
understand the behavior of a ten-line decentralized computer program written by
a high-school student.
<P><B>* A Traffic Jam Isn't Just a Collection of Cars</B>
<P><B></B>For most everyday objects, it is fair to think of the object as a
collection of particular parts: a chair has four particular legs, a particular
seat, and so on. But not so with objects like traffic jams. Thinking of a
traffic jam as a collection of particular parts leads to confusion. The cars
composing a traffic jam are always changing, as some cars leave the front of the
jam and other join from behind. Even when all of the cars in the jam are
replaced with new cars, it is still the same traffic jam. A traffic jam can be
thought of as an "emergent object"--it emerges from the interactions among
lower-level objects (in this case, cars).
<P>As students worked on StarLogo projects, they encountered many emergent
objects. In the termite example, the wood-chip piles can be viewed as emergent
objects. The precise composition of the piles is always changing, as termites
take away some wood chips and add other wood chips. After a while, none of the
original wood chips remains, but the pile is still there.
<P>Initially, many students had difficulty thinking about emergent objects. In
the ant-cemetery project, Frank and Ramesh were adamant that dead ants should
never be taken from a cemetery once placed there. They felt that the ants
themselves defined the cemetery. How can a cemetery grow, they argued, if the
dead ants in it are continually being taken away? In fact, if Frank and Ramesh
had viewed the cemetery as an emergent object and allowed the composition of
ant-cemeteries to vary with time (as Callie and I allowed the composition of the
wood-chip piles to vary in the termite project), they probably would have been
much more successful in their project.
<P><B>* The Hills are Alive</B>
<P><B></B>In <I>Sciences of the Artificial</I> (1969), Herbert Simon describes a
scene in which an ant is walking on a beach. Simon notes that the ant's path
might be quite complex. But the complexity of the path, says Simon, is not
necessarily a reflection of the complexity of the ant. Rather, it might reflect
the complexity of the beach. Simon's point: don't underestimate the role of the
environment in influencing and constraining behavior. People often think of the
environment as something to be <I>acted upon</I>, not something to be
<I>interacted with</I>. People tend to focus on the behaviors of individual
objects, ignoring the environment that surrounds (and interacts with) the
objects.
<P>A richer view of the environment is important in thinking about decentralized
and self-organizing systems. In designing StarLogo, I explicitly tried to
highlight the environment. Most creature-oriented programming environments treat
the environment as a passive entity, manipulated by the creature that move
within it. In StarLogo, by contrast, the "patches" of the world have equal
status with the creatures that move in the world. By reifying the environment, I
hoped to encourage people to think about the environment in new ways.
<P>Initially, some students resisted the idea of an active environment. When I
explained a StarLogo ant-foraging program to one student, he was worried that
pheromone trails would continue to attract ants even after the food sources at
the ends of the trails had been fully depleted. He developed an elaborate scheme
in which the ants, after collecting all of the food, deposited a second
pheromone to neutralize the first pheromone. It never occurred to him to let the
first pheromone evaporate away. In his mind, the ants had to take some positive
action to get rid of the first pheromone. They could not rely on the environment
to make the first pheromone go away.
<P>
<P><B>6. Conclusions</B>
<P><B></B>This paper should be viewed as an opening foray, not a final word. It
represents a first step in a broader research agenda aimed at (a) studying how
people make sense of complex phenomena and (b) developing new tools and
activities to encourage and support new ways of thinking about complex
phenomena. The paper identifies the idea of decentralization as a particularly
productive dimension for analyzing people's understanding of complex systems.
The paper introduces the concept of the "centralized mindset" and provides
initial evidence of the strength and pervasiveness of this mindset. It discusses
a new computational modeling environment, StarLogo, designed to probe and
challenge how people think about centralized and decentralized systems.
<P>There are many ways in which the research presented here needs to be extended
and deepened. Areas for further investigation include:
<P>
<UL>
  <LI><I>Nature of the centralized mindset</I>. This paper presents a very
  coarse description of the centralized mindset, arguing that people usually
  interpret patterns as created "by lead" or "by seed." More detailed and more
  textured models are needed. What are the "knowledge fragments" (diSessa, 1988)
  that underlie the centralized mindset? How are different fragments mobilized
  in different contexts?
  <P></P>
  <LI><I>Origins of the centralized mindset</I>. This paper points to several
  possible reasons for the strength and pervasiveness of the centralized
  mindset--most notably, the dominant metaphor of the singular self. Future
  research should examine how the centralized mindset differs from one person to
  another. What accounts for the differences? Culture? Gender? Scientific
  background? Particular life experiences?
  <P></P>
  <LI><I>Paths toward decentralized thinking</I>. The "guiding heuristics"
  discussed in section 5 serve as milestones in the development of decentralized
  thinking. But what conceptual shifts are necessary for people to develop these
  heuristics? What are the obstacles to making these shifts? How can students
  build on, refine, and reorganize their prior understandings and intuitions?
  <P></P>
  <LI><I>Relation to learning theories</I>. This paper focuses specifically on
  ways that students think about complex systems, but the tension between
  centralization and decentralization arises in all types of reasoning, design,
  and problem solving. What are the implications of the centralized mindset for
  understanding, reasoning, and learning in general?
  <P></P>
  <LI><I>Better computational tools</I>. StarLogo is just a beginning. We need
  better tools for visualizing and manipulating decentralized interactions, and
  for enabling multiple students to collaboratively construct and explore
  decentralized models. One direction for future development: use the
  decentralized framework of the Internet as a setting for explorations into
  decentralized behavior.
  <P></P>
  <LI><I>Integration of centralization and decentralization</I>. This paper
  sometimes creates a simple dichotomy between centralization and
  decentralization. It does so to highlight the fact that decentralized
  approaches have been undervalued and overlooked in the past. Ultimately, we
  need to develop tools and theories that avoid this simple dichotomy. Instead,
  we need to find ways of integrating the two approaches, drawing on the
  advantages of each. </LI></UL>
<P>Until recently, only a handful of people have had access to StarLogo, because
the software ran only on expensive computers. A Macintosh version of StarLogo is
now available, so there is an opportunity for many more students to create and
explore decentralized models--and for many more researchers to investigate the
issues surrounding decentralized thinking. Readers are encouraged to send a
message to <TT>starlogo-request@media.mit.edu</TT> to get a copy of StarLogo
software and to join in this research effort.
